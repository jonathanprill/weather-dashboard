# Weather Dashboard

The client would like a simple weather forecast application so users can search for a city and get the current weather along with a 5 day forecast.
This app will utilize the openweathermap API and display accurate weather data for each searched city.
Recent searches should be randered as workable buttons on the sidebar.
